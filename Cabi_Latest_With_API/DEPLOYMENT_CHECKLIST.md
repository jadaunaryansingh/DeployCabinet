ls -la dist/spa/

# Test with local server
npx serve dist/spa/
```

### Step 2: Netlify Deployment

   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   - Trigger initial deployment
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify all routes work
